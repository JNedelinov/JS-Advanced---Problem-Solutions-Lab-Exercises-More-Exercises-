These are all of my solutions from the JavaScript Advanced course at SoftUni.

The material I went through:
  1. Syntax, Functions and Statements;
  2. Arrays;
  3. Object and Classes;
  4. DOM;
  5. DOM Manipulations;
  6. Function Context;
  7. Advanced Functions;
  8. Object Composition;
  9. Prototypes and Inheritance.

Lab lecture exercises;
  * Exercise lecture exercises;
  * Previous exams that I used to prepare myself for the Mid Exam and the Final Exam.
  * Some of the solutions are simpler than others. You might notice that I have used different techniques for some exercises, just because I wanted to experiment with which style might work the best for me.

I hope I could help students from the same learning path in SoftUni as me.
